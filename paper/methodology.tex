\subsection{2x2 Difference in Differences}
%derive the explanation of 2x2 difference in difference from classic to TWFE and talk about heterogeneous effects
To introduce a common ground for the rest of the thesis I want to introduce the notation for the basic 2x2 \ac{did} model.
The model has two time periods given by $T$, where $t \in 0, 1$. These define the pre- and post-treatment period of the policy change.
Note that I use in the whole thesis panel data such that $i$ denotes the individual over time periods.
The two groups are defined by $D$, where $d \in 0, 1$, such that $d = 1$ is the treatment group and $d = 0$ is the control group.
The outcome variable is given by $Y$ and the variable of interest, the \ac{att}, is given by $\tau^{fe} = \mathbb{E}(Y_{1,1} - Y_{0,1} \mid  X,D = 1)$.
Therefore the \ac{att} describes the expected difference in outcomes between the treated group (when they receive the treatment) and what their outcomes would have been if they had not received the treatment.
For my \ac{mcs} I use the following common \ac{twfe} model notation to display the 2x2 \ac{did} as in \citet{santannaDoublyRobustDifferenceindifferences2020}:
\begin{equation}
Y_{it} = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 T_i + \alpha_3 D_i + \tau^{fe} (T_i \cdot D_i) + \theta' X_i + \epsilon_{it}
\label{eq:twfe}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:twfe} implicates two assumptions that are of main focus in this thesis.
First, it assumes homogeneity in treatment effects, such that $\tau^{fe}$ is constant over all individuals.
Second, it assumes that the \ac{pta} holds, such that the treatment and control group would have developed similarly in the absence of the policy change such that $\mathbb{E} [Y_1 - Y_0 \mid X, D = d] = \mathbb{E} [Y_1 - Y_0 \mid D = d]$.
If one or both of these assumptions are violated the \ac{twfe} estimator in Eq. \ref{eq:twfe} is inconsistent and biased.

To control for heterogeneous treatment effects and to account for conditional \ac{pta}, we can extend the model in Eq. \ref{eq:twfe} by adding interactions of $X$, $T$, and $D$ \citep[see][]{manfeDifferenceInDifferenceDesignRepeated, hansen2022econometrics}.
Therefore we can rewrite the Eq. \ref{eq:twfe} the following:
\begin{equation}
    Y_{it} = \alpha + \gamma T_{it} + \beta D_{i} + \tau^{corr} (T_{it} \cdot D_{i}) + X_{it}' \theta + (T_{it} \cdot X_{it}') \omega + (D_{i} \cdot X_{it}') \nu + (T_{it} \cdot D_{i} \cdot X_{it}') \rho + \epsilon_{it}
    \label{eq:twfecorr}
\end{equation}
Note that $T_{it} \cdot D_{i} \cdot X_{it}'$ is the change of the treatment depending on X and thus the conditional \ac{pta} holds \citep{manfeDifferenceInDifferenceDesignRepeated}.
Eq. \ref{eq:twfecorr} is therefore, in a correctly specified case, neither biased nor inconsistent.
The issue is that the econometric practitioner needs very good reasoning and understanding to add the right interactions.
In the following sections I introduce more flexible techniques circumventing this issue.

\subsection{Outcome Regression}
In this part, I revise \ac{or} as it is an important technique used in \ac{drdid}, rather than using \ac{or} itself for estimating.
\ac{or} is a generalized \ac{did} estimation approach that estimates the outcomes as a function of covariates, given by $Y_i = g_i(X) + \epsilon_i$, where $i \in 0,1$.
The basic idea is to predict the control group outcomes based on their covariates and then compare these predicted outcomes to the actual outcomes observed for the treated group.
The prediction can be done trough a linear regression or other non-linear models like p-nearest neighbor matching \parencite{heckmanMatchingEconometricEvaluation1998}.
In this thesis, I fit a regression to estimate \ac{or} within the \ac{drdid} framework, allowing to formulate the following model:
\begin{equation}
\tau^{or} = \bar{Y}_{1,1} - \bar{Y}_{1,0} - \left[ \frac{1}{n_{treat}} \sum_{i \mid D_i = 1} \left( \hat{\mu}_{0,1}(X_i) - \hat{\mu}_{0,0}(X_i) \right) \right],
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{Y}_{1,1} - \bar{Y}_{1,0}$ is the average outcome among treated units between pre- and post-treatment period.
The part in brackets of eq. \ref{eq:3} is the difference between the predicted control outcomes in the post- and the predicted control outcomes in the pre-treatment period.
The key expression is $\hat{\mu}_{d,t}(X)$ which estimates the true, unknown $m_{d,t}(x) \equiv \mathbb{E}[Y_t \mid D = d, X = x]$.
Intuitively, it estimates what the outcome would be for a person with specific traits if they were either treated or not treated.
Note that if $\hat{\mu}_{d,t}(X)$ is linear it would be close to the correct \ac{twfe} estimator $\tau^{corr}$.
Finally, it is crucial that $\hat{\mu}_{d,t}(X)$ is correctly specified; otherwise the \ac{att} is biased and inconsistent.
