This thesis wants to contribute in four ways to the literature. %explain more
First, I want to revise the current state of Machine Learning techniques used for Difference-in-Difference estimation.%explain more
Second, I introduce a new approach that uses Deep Learning for Difference-in-Difference estimation.%explain more
Third, I want to provide a comprehensive Monte Carlo study to compare the performance of these techniques.%explain more
Lastly, I want to apply these techniques to a real-world dataset to show the potential of these techniques.%explain more
