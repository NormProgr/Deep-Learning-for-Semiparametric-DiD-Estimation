%%ausblick auf neue deep learning approaches (direct estimation with deepl by farrel paper 2)
A relatevely new approach to use deep learning for inference is the direct estimation of the treatment effect.
Meaning that instead of placing deep learning within a semiparametric framework it is used to recover directly the parameter functions as suggested by the work of \citet{DeepLearningIndividual2021}.
