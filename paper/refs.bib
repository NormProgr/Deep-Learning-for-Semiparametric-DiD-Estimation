  abstract = {The German parental leave reform of 2007 created a new incentive for men to take parental leave by introducing ‘daddy months’: 2 months of well-remunerated leave exclusively reserved for fathers. Against the backdrop of the reform, this study examines how fathers’ uptake of parental leave affects the amount of time they spend on paid work, housework, and childcare after the leave has ended. It investigates whether the effect of parental leave differs by the length of leave taken and by whether fathers took the leave alone or at the same time as their partners. Using data from the German SocioEconomic Panel from 2006 to 2012 and Families in Germany from 2010 to 2012, the results of fixedeffects regressions indicate that fathers who took parental leave subsequently reallocated their time from work to home. They reduced their working hours and increased their involvement in childcare even after short and joint periods of parental leave. But only those who took {$>$}2 months of leave or were on leave while their partner was working subsequently increased their participation in housework. Hence, fathers increased their involvement in childcare already after short leaves, whereas enhanced gender equality in couples’ division of labour especially emerged after longer or solo leaves.},

abstract = {Many causal and structural effects depend on regressions. Examples include policy effects, average derivatives, regression decompositions, average treatment effects, causal mediation, and parameters of economic structural models. The regressions may be high-dimensional, making machine learning useful. Plugging machine learners into identifying equations can lead to poor inference due to bias from regularization and/or model selection. This paper gives automatic debiasing for linear and nonlinear functions of regressions. The debiasing is automatic in using Lasso and the function of interest without the full form of the bias correction. The debiasing can be applied to any regression learner, including neural nets, random forests, Lasso, boosting, and other high-dimensional methods. In addition to providing the bias correction, we give standard errors that are robust to misspecification, convergence rates for the bias correction, and primitive conditions for asymptotic inference for estimators of a variety of estimators of structural and causal effects. The automatic debiased machine learning is used to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for the NSW job training data and to estimate demand elasticities from Nielsen scanner data while allowing preferences to be correlated with prices and income.},

I use the unanticipated reform of 2007 to assess how a move from a means tested to an earnings-related benefit affects higherorder births. By using data from the Mikrozensus, I find that the reform significantly affected the timing of higher-order births in the first 5 years after a last birth. Overall, mothers “just” eligible for the new benefit for the current birth initially reduce subsequent childbearing and extend birth spacing, compared to mothers “just” ineligible. However, by the end of the third year, mothers start to compensate for the earlier losses. The negative effects are largely driven by the low-income mothers, who are now worse-off and do not display any catch-up effects. The differential fertility responses along the income distribution are in line with the heterogeneous structure of the economic incentives.},

We make a parallel-trends assumption, and propose event-study estimators of the effect of being exposed to a weakly higher treatment dose for ℓ periods. We also propose normalized estimators, that estimate a weighted average of the effects of the current treatment and its lags. We also analyze commonly-used two-way-fixed-effects regressions. Unlike our estimators, they can be biased in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects. A local-projection version of those regressions is biased even with homogeneous effects. ∗We are very grateful to Diego Ciccia, Felix Knau, Mélitine Malézieux and Doulo Sow for their outstanding research assistance.

  abstract = {We develop methodology for estimation and inference using machine learning to enrich economic models. Our framework takes a standard economic model and recasts the parameters as fully flexible nonparametric functions, to capture the rich heterogeneity based on potentially high dimensional or complex observable characteristics. These “parameter functions” retain the interpretability, economic meaning, and discipline of classical parameters. In contrast to common implementations of machine learning in economics, these functions need not be predictions. We show that deep learning is particularly well-suited to structured modeling of heterogeneity in economics. First, we show how the network architecture can be easily designed to match the global structure of the economic model, delivering novel methodology that moves deep learning beyond prediction. Second, we prove convergence rates for the estimated parameter functions. These parameter functions are then the key input into the finite-dimensional parameter of inferential interest. We obtain valid inference based on a novel orthogonal score or influence function calculation that covers any second-stage parameter and any machine-learning-enriched model that uses a smooth per-observation loss function. No additional derivations are required and the score can be taken directly to data, using automatic differentiation if needed to obtain the components: the researcher need only define the original model and define the parameter of interest. A key insight is that we need not write down the influence function in order to evaluate it on the data. We apply this after deep learning, but our result can be used for any first-step estimator. Our framework covers, as special cases, well-known examples such as average treatment effects and partially linear models, but we also seamlessly deliver new results for such diverse examples as price elasticities, willingness-to-pay, and surplus measures in binary or multinomial choice models, average marginal and partial effects of continuous treatment variables, fractional outcome models, count data, heterogeneous production function components, and more. Across all these contexts inference can be made as automated as is currently available in special cases. We illustrate the utility of our framework with an application to a large scale advertising experiment for short-term loans. We show how economically meaningful estimates and inferences can be made that would be unavailable without our framework.},

This finding is established using US branching deregulations between 1994 and 2005 as instruments for credit. Credit increases for deregulated banks, but not in placebo samples. Such differential responses rule out demand-based explanations, and identify an exogenous credit supply shock. Because of geographic diver-sification, treated banks expand credit: housing demand increases, house prices rise, but to a lesser extent in areas with elastic housing supply, where the housing stock increases instead. In an instrumental variable sense, house prices are well explained by the credit expansion induced by deregulation. (JEL G21, G28, R21, R31)},

  abstract = {It is well understood that government policies can distort behavior. But what is less often recognized is that the anticipated introduction of a policy can introduce its own distortions. We study one such “introduction effect,” using evidence from a unique policy change in Australia. In 2004, the Australian government announced that children born on or after July 1, 2004 would receive a \$3000 “Baby Bonus.” Although the policy was only announced seven weeks before its introduction, parents appear to have behaved strategically in order to receive the benefit, with the number of births dipping sharply before the policy commenced. On July 1, 2004, more Australian children were born than on any other single date in the past thirty years. We estimate that over 1000 births were “moved” so as to ensure that their parents were eligible for the Baby Bonus, with about one quarter being moved by more than one week. Most of the effect was due to changes in the timing of induction and cesarean section procedures. We find evidence to suggest that babies who were shifted into the eligibility period were more likely to be of high birth weight. Two years later, on July 1, 2006, the Baby Bonus was increased, and we find that this again caused births to be moved from June to July. These birth timing events represent an opportunity for health researchers to study the impact of planned birthdays and hospital management issues.},

This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of twoway fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several OECD countries have taken steps to promote policies encouraging fathers to spend more time caring for young children, thereby promoting a more gender equal division of care work. Evidence, mainly for the United States and United Kingdom, has shown fathers taking some time off work around childbirth are more likely to be involved in childcare related activities than fathers who do not take time off. This paper conducts a first cross-national analysis on the association between fathers’ leave taking and fathers’ involvement when children are young. It uses birth cohort data of children born around 2000 from four OECD countries: Australia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States. Results show that the majority of fathers take time off around childbirth independent of the leave policies in place. In all countries, except Denmark, important socio-economic differences between fathers who take leave and those who do not are observed. In addition, fathers who take leave, especially those taking two weeks or more, are more likely to carry out childcare related activities when children are young. This study adds to the evidence that suggests that parental leave for fathers is positively associated with subsequent paternal involvement.},

We estimate the model using Danish register data on almost 200,000 births combined with sharp variation in economic incentives created by the parental leave benefit system. The estimated model reproduces the empirical distribution of leave, including bunching at kinks in household budget sets and a large share of fathers taking little or no leave at all. We provide a menu of counterfactual policy simulations showing substantial interaction effects between earmarked leave, replacement rates and the duration of leave benefits. For example, introducing 9 weeks earmarked parental leave, as stipulated by a recent EU directive, with a low replacement rate increases the leave of fathers only slightly, while it reduces the leave of mothers significantly in our model. Finally, we discuss the efficiency costs of different policies aimed at increasing the parental leave of fathers.},

We study how these two policy instruments affect return-to-work and medium-run labour market outcomes of mothers of newborn children.Analysing a series of major PL policy changes inAustria, we find that longer cash benefits lead to a significant delay in return-to-work, particularly so in the period that is job-protected. Prolonged parental leave absence induced by these policy changes does not appear to hurt mothers’ labour market outcomes in the medium run. We build a non-stationary model of job search after childbirth to isolate the role of the two policy instruments. The model matches return-to-work and return to same employer profiles under the various factual policy configurations. Counterfactual policy simulations indicate that a system that combines cash with protection dominates other systems in generating time for care immediately after birth while maintaining mothers’ medium-run labour market attachment.},

Building on Abadie (2005), we propose a Double Inverse Probability Weighting (DIPW) estimator for repeated cross-sections based on both the probability of being treated and of belonging to the post-treatment period and derive its doubly-robust version (DR-DIPW), similarly as in Sant’Anna and Zhao (2020). Through Monte Carlo simulations, we compare its performance with a number of methods suggested by the literature, which span from the basic TWFE (and our proposed correction) to semi-parametric estimators, including those using machine-learning first-stage estimates, following Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Results show that DR-DIPW outperforms the other estimators in most realistic scenarios, even if TWFE corrections provide substantial benefits. Following Sequeira (2016), we estimate the effect of tariff reduction on bribing behavior by analyzing trades between South Africa and Mozambique during the period 2006–2014. Contrarily to the replication by Chang (2020), our findings show that the effect is lower in magnitude than the one presented in the original paper.},

Further, little is known about their long-term effects on household behavior. I examine the Quebec Parental Insurance Program, which improved compensation and reserved 5 weeks of leave for fathers. I find that fathers’ participation increased by 250\%, driven by a combination of higher benefits and the framing effect of labeling some weeks as ‘daddy’-only. I also present causal evidence that paternity leave reduces sex specialization long after the leave period.},

  abstract = {Using Norwegian registry data, we investigate the effect of paternity leave on fathers’ long-term earnings. If the paternity leave increased long-term father involvement, then we should expect a reduction in fathers’ long-term earnings as they shift time and effort from market to home production. For identification, we use the Norwegian introduction of a paternity-leave quota in 1993, reserving four weeks of the total of 42 weeks of paid parental leave exclusively for the father. The introduction of the paternity-leave quota led to a sharp increase in rates of leavetaking for fathers. We estimate a difference-in-differences model that exploits differences in fathers’ exposure to the paternity-leave quota by the child’s age and year of observation. Our analysis suggests that four weeks of paternity leave during the child’s first year decreases fathers’ future earnings, an effect that persists through our last point of observation, when the child is 5 years old. A battery of robustness tests supports our results.},

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

  abstract = {In Europe, there has been an increasing emphasis on the equal rights of men and women to parental leave. Nordic countries such as Iceland are often seen as forerunners in the implementation of laws that promote gender equality by giving each parent non-transferable rights to parental leave. In October 2008, the Icelandic banking system collapsed and a severe economic recession followed. This can be seen as a natural experimental intervention and provides a unique opportunity to study potential changes in fathers’ use of parental leave in response to drastic economic changes and resulting policy changes. Our data show that during the years 2003–2007, a time of economic prosperity, Icelandic fathers on average used 3 full months of parental leave. After this event, fathers’ use of parental leave declined, while the reverse could be seen for mothers who progressively took a longer leave with partial pay. Our analysis suggests that a decline in fathers’ use of parental leave can be traced back to the dramatic collapse of the economic system and the subsequent substantial lowering of the maximum payment during parental leave. The most dramatic changes were seen for fathers in high-income groups whose payments during parental leave were most severely cut. The data suggest that after the economic collapse and resulting policy changes, women have become increasingly responsible and men decreasingly responsible for childcare duties – an alarming trend from the standpoint of gender equality. Possible remedies and courses of action are discussed.},

Semi-parametric difference-in-differences estimation based on survey data from the German Microcensus results in positive effects on the employment rate, as well as on agreed and preferred working hours by up to 20\% of the pre-reform mean. As agreed and preferred working hours adjust in line with each other, the expansion of early child care can tap labor market potentials beyond those of currently underemployed mothers. Moreover, conditional effects show that especially better educated and non-single mothers respond to the reform.},
