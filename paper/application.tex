\section{Application}

An early application of \ac{did} is the paper of \citet{meyer1990workers} that investigate the effect of a workers' compensation on their time out of work.
In 1980 the states of Kentucky and Michigan substantially increased the compensations in case of work induced disability or injury.
As the policy just affected high-earning workers, \citet{meyer1990workers} took low-earning workers as a control group.
Their idea is that low- and high earning workers are comparable except for the fact that high earning workers are treated with the compensation policy.
In their original study they report a significant increase in time out of work for Kentucky but not for Michigan.
Due to the low sample size for Michigan I focus solely on Kentucky.




The dataset is taken from the online ressources of \citet{wooldridge2019introductory}



\begin{equation}
\text{Duration}_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Post}_t + \beta_2 \text{HighEarnings}_i + \beta_3 (\text{Post}_t \times \text{HighEarnings}_i) + \gamma X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
